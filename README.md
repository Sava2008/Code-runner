# Code-runner
Download both the logs.txt and code_runner.py files, dump them into one directory, copy the path to the script and add a shortcut with the following command:
```text
cmd /k python "C:\path\to\code_runner.py" "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)"
```
logs.txt will collect every log and track errors. For bug reports, feel free to send me the logs.txt file.
right now only 3 three programming languages are supported, but more are planned to be implemented. I'll provide a better readme file tomorrow.
